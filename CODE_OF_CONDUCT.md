# Community Code of Conduct

Everything that you post on this repository, from discussions to pull requests, are completely public. This is a community-made extension for people who like to code. People of all ages.

## Be Kind

Don't hurt other people's feelings. Let everyone feel happy in this space, and try to make sure everyone's comfortable sharing their ideas. ScratchTools runs off of the community's ideas, so it's the more the merrier. This also means no hate speech, and try to keep cursing to a minimum. There's not much of a reason to use it on a code repository, although we get it if it's just in our [Community Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/YT4rufeN23)

## Be Helpful

If you can, we love suggestions!! All of our developers love to see new ideas, and so do the users. We're also very grateful for bug reports. ScratchTools wants to make sure that their code works 100%. You can submit a bug report or suggestion on our [Community Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/YT4rufeN23)

## Also...

Please follow the [Scratch Community Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines) as the communities are the same between both Scratch and ScratchTools.

      <h1>ScratchTools 3.0</h1>
      <p>We highly recommend you look through what's new- there's a lot.</p>

            <h1>Shared Clipboard</h1>
            <p>
              When you copy an object from the paint editor, you can only paste
              it to different places within that project. Now, you can paste it
              between projects. You can copy a costume from one project and
              paste it into another one!

            <h1>Important Messages</h1>
            <p>
              ScratchTools is introducing artificial intelligence. This brand
              new feature uses AI to determine which messages are important for
              you to read, and then highlights them at the top, above the rest
              of your messages.
            </p>

            <h1>Slash to Search</h1>
            <p>
              Similar to many other websites, now you can simply click the slash
              key to select the search bar and then begin typing.
            </p>

            <h1>Hide Footer</h1>
            <p>
              The Scratch website's footer isn't known for including many
              helpful links, so now you can easily hide it and remove it from
              the bottom of the page.
            </p>

          <div class="feature-image" data-feature="hide-footer"></div>

            <h1>Simplify Action Buttons</h1>
            <p>
              Now, on project pages, you can minimize the action buttons below
              the Notes & Credits, and only see the icons. They take up much
              less space.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div
            class="feature-image"

          ></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1>Themes!</h1>
      <p>You can now customize the settings page with dozens of themes!</p>
      <img class="theme-img" src="./images/themes.png" />
      <p>
        We're very excited for themes, and we've worked hard to make sure that
        we can create themes for both dark and light mode users, that perfectly
        suit the settings page. And we're constantly adding even more! Soon,
        you'll be able to make your own and put them on the theme store!
      </p>
      <h1>Support Center</h1>
      <p>
        This is a change that we are <b>very</b> excited to announce. Now, if
        you need help with ScratchTools, you can use the support center. You can
        check through quick answers, or even open up a live chat support session
        with ScratchTools support specialists.
      </p>
      <div class="img-row">
        <img src="./images/support.png" />
        <img src="./images/chat.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        You can easily access the Support Center via the link in the bottom-left
        corner of the settings page, next to the "Additional settings" and "Give
        feedback" buttons.
      </p>
      <h1>Better Feedback Center</h1>
      <p>
        We very much appreciate when you send us feedback on features, and we
        read ALL of it. However, it isn't always easy to respond to the
        feedback. Starting now, we can respond to all feedback sent via the
        extension, and you'll see the messages we sent in the feedback center!
      </p>
      <img class="theme-img" src="./images/feedback.png" />
      <p>
        On the settings page, if you see something like
        <span class="notification">1</span> in the bottom-left corner, it means
        you have 1 or more messages! You can click on it to view your messages
        or send additional feedback!
      </p>
      <h1>Import and Export Your Settings</h1>
      <p>
        Your settings are like a piece of art, made by you, customized to your
        liking. Now, you can share it with your friends, or use it on other
        devices. You can simply click the "Additional settings" button in the
        bottom-left corner, and then either export or import settings!
      </p>
      <h1>Revert to Blue is <i>Much</i> Better</h1>
      <p>
        Many Scratchers still miss the blue website, so we brought it back in
        the last version. Now, it works even better. It's almost magical, the
        entire website is entirely blue again. It's seamless, better than anything else out there.
      </p>
      <img class="theme-img" src="./images/better-blue.png">
      <h1>More Tutorials is Back</h1>
      <p>
        We've reintroduced the More Tutorials feature, and it works better than ever! We can now add even more tutorials to the page instantly, without needing to update the extension on your end. You'll see new tutorials on the Ideas page as they release on YouTube.
      </p>
      <h1>Coming Later in 3.0</h1>
      <p>Not everything made it out in this release, and we're still working on more!</p>
      <h2>Account Switching</h2>
      <p>Switch between your alternate accounts!</p>
      <h2>Website Dark Mode</h2>
      <p>Customize the colors of the Scratch website, just like the settings page!</p>
      <h2>Full Translations</h2>
      <p>We're finalizing all translations for multiple languages right now, and they'll be available soon!</p>
      <h1>Other Changes</h1>
      <p>Autoselect search bar on settings page</p>
      <p>Search filters</p>
      <p>Better onboarding</p>
      <p>Fix duplicating clone counter</p>
      <p>Fix TurboWarp button with unshared projects</p>
      <p>Fix Idea Generator</p>
      <h1>Thank You</h1>
      <p>We appreciate everyone who uses ScratchTools. We turned 1 earlier this year, and it's been a long journey to get where we are today. We couldn't have done it without each and every person who has used ScratchTools, coded ScratchTools, translated ScratchTools, or given feedback to ScratchTools.</p>
      <p>We appreciate all that you've done.</p>
